# Communication Protocol

## Premise

The communication protocol used is **JSON** based so it is completly **language indipendent**.
Using the provided documentation you can write your own client for our application using your favourite language.

## Message Structure
All messages share the following structure:

- username (String)
    - Client -> Server :  username of the message sender
    - Server -> Client :
        - Model messages: username of the player that changed his model state
        - non-Model messages: username of the receiver (BroadCast on null)
- messageType (enum)
- payload (String)
    - if messageType == ACTION -> then payload is a JSON representation of an action class;
    - if messageType == MODEL_UPDATE -> then payload is a JSON representation of the objects that contains the changes made to the model;
    - if messageType == ERROR -> then payload is a JSON representation of the error enumeration.


## Communication Examples


### Checking nodes connection
When connection is established both server and client set a socket timeout. Then client and server keep sending each other periodical messages to keep the timeout from expiring.<br>
Note: this isnâ€™t a request - reply protocol. Every message is standAlone.<br>

## Write your own client

Here are some advices if you want to use the API provided by our server to create your own client in java using some of our classes.

Remember to also reference the [Communication Protocol](#COMMUNICATION-PROTOCOL) documentation for more
informations on protocol structure.

#### Recieving a Message: Client <- Server
Upon reading a JSON from the socket, the client should parse it into a ` Message ` class.

For example:
  ```java
 while (true) {
          Message msg = messageParserFromJson(in.readLine());
          client.handleMessage(msg);
        }
```

You can than parse the object contained in the message in one of the provided
` updateContainers classes ` using the ` getPayloadByType() ` method.

For example:
 ```java
   WarehouseUpdate stateUpdate  = msg.getPayloadByType(WarehouseUpdate.class);
```

If you have trouble finding the right object you can simply call the ` getPayload() ` method to view
a JSON representation of the received Object or look at [Messages Table](#Messages-Table) documentation.

#### Sending a message: Client -> Server

In most cases, messages sent to Server contain an [Action](#Action-Table) as payload.

Here is an example of how to create a message countaining a specific action:
```java
   Action buyCardAction = new BuyDevelopCardAction(row, column, cardSlot);
```
