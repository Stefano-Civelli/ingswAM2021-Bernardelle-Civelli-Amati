## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

## Message Structure
All messages share the following structure:

- username (String) 
  - Client -> Server :  username of the message sender
  - Server -> Client :  
    - Model messages: username of the player that changed his model state
    - non-Model messages: username of the receiver (BroadCast on null)
- messageType (enum)
- payload (String)
  - if messageType == ACTION -> then payload is a JSON representation of an action class;
  - if messageType == MODEL_UPDATE -> then payload is a JSON representation of the objects (created as inner class) that contains the changes made to the model.

## API Reference

Here are some advices if you want to use the API provided by our server to create your own client.

Remember to also reference the [Communication Protocol](#COMMUNICATION-PROTOCOL) documentation for more 
informations on protocol structure.

#### Recieving a Message: Client <- Server
Upon reading a JSON from the socket, the client should parse it into a ` Message ` class.

For example:
  ```java
 while (true) {
          Message msg = messageParserFromJson(in.readLine());
          client.handleMessage(msg);
        }
```

You can than parse the object contained in the message in one of the provided
` updateContainers classes ` using the ` getPayloadByType() ` method.

For example:
 ```java
   WarehouseUpdate stateUpdate  = msg.getPayloadByType(WarehouseUpdate.class)
```

If you have trouble finding the right object you can simply call the ` getPayload() ` method to view
a JSON representation of the received Object or look at [Messages Table](#Messages-Table) documentation.

#### Sending a message: Client -> Server

In most cases, messages sent to Server contain an [Action](#Action-Table) as payload.

Here is an example of how to create a message countaining a specific action:
```java
   Action buyCardAction = new BuyDevelopCardAction(row, column, cardSlot);
```
